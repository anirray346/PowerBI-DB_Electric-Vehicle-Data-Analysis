⚡ Electric Vehicle Data Analysis – Power BI Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption and distribution across the United States. The dashboard transforms raw EV registration data into actionable insights related to vehicle type, manufacturer dominance, geographic spread, and model-wise performance.

🎯 Business Objectives

Analyze overall EV adoption trends over time

Compare Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) vs Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV)

Identify top EV manufacturers and models

Understand state-wise distribution of electric vehicles

Evaluate CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility impact

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains structured information related to electric vehicles, including:

Vehicle Make & Model

Model Year

Electric Vehicle Type (BEV / PHEV)

Electric Range

CAFV Eligibility Status

State-wise Registration Data

📈 Dashboard Highlights & Insights
🔹 Key KPIs
